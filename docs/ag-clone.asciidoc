== NAME ==
ag-clone - clone project.

== SYNOPSIS ==
[verse]
'ag clone' [<project file url>]

== DESCRIPTION ==
Clones all project components into subdirectories (named after component names) of the working directory. If a component has an alias, a symlink, named after it, is created and points to the component directory. 

If *url* is specified, downloads the project file from the given location (_curl_ is required for this). Otherwise, requires *agnostic.yaml* file to present in the working directory.
